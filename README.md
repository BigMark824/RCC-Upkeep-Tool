 This tool is used to ensure that RCCService stays up in the event of a gameserver crash!

# How to build
I personally used visual studio 2022 to develop this, all you have to do is open the .sln and compile!

You can easily port this to something like CMAKE!

Edit: It's setup for x86 Release
# Usage
Simply run the exe, it will open RCCService and track its status!

# Libraries used

* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
* [winsock2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/)

If you don't want to build I've left a compiled version in releases!
